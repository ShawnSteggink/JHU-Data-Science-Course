This analysis takes the movement data provided for subjects across 6 activities: 
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. 
An embedded accelerometer and gyroscope was used to capture the initial data. 

From the initial data, the only varibales retained were those relating to either "mean" or "standard deviation". 
For many variables, 3 values are provided, each a component of the vector which they represent when taken together. These have been
provided in their own columns.

The code I wrote to summarize the data first processes each provided subset before combining appending them together and
summarizing retained variables at the subject-activity level.

I've retained the names of the variables in the provided data because they are already as decriptive in the fullest sense possible 
in that each describes what the variable name is and includes the measurement taken in the fewest characters possible.

The first 3 columns contain the subject ID number, activity, and activity number (respectively) which, when taken with the meaning of 
each variable via the variables_info file, allow you to make snese of the data.

The following files are included:
=========================================

- 'README_GACD_Project.txt'

- 'variables_info.txt': Describes each of the variables retained in this analysis. 

- 'run_analysis.R': R code which processes, aggregates, refines, and summarizes the raw data.
