----------------------------Overview-------------------------------

This analysis takes the movement data provided for subjects across 6 activities: 
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. 
An embedded accelerometer and gyroscope was used to capture the initial data. 

From the initial data, the only varibales retained were those relating to either "mean" or "standard deviation". 
For many variables, 3 values are provided, each a component of the vector which they represent when taken together. These have been
provided in their own columns.

The output data set is unique at the subject-activity level. An average function has been used to aggregate the data to this level, 
taking averages across mean and standard deviation measurements for all subject-activity pairs. In other words, when a subject 
has multiple observations for a particular activity, the average of each variable relevant to those observations will be taken 
and provided in the output table.

--------------------------Notes on Code----------------------------

The code I wrote to summarize the data first processes each provided subset before appending them together and
summarizing retained variables at the subject-activity level.

Please note that prior to running this code I formatted two of the input files, activity_labels and features, as csv files in excel 
to make them easier to import. Each is a two column table without headings, which I created by dragging the original text file of 
each into excel and using excel's 'text to data' function to separate the data into columns on the basis of spaces. The code then 
imports these files.

I've retained the names of the variables in the provided data because they are already as decriptive in the fullest sense possible 
in that each describes what the variable name is and includes the measurement taken for the metric in the fewest characters possible.

Regarding the output table, the first 3 columns contain the subject ID number, activity, and activity number (respectively) which, 
when taken with the meaning of each variable via the variables_info file, allow you to make sense of the data.

- 'variables_info.txt': Describes each of the variables retained in this analysis. These are the headings in the data.

- 'run_analysis.R': R code which processes, aggregates, refines, and summarizes the raw data.
